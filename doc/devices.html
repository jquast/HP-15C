    <h2><a id="overview">Overview</a></h2>

    <h3>DM15</h3>
    The original size DM15L and the credit card sized DM-15CC/DM-15 are HP-15C clones offered by
    <a href="https://www.swissmicros.com" target="_blank" class="internal">SwissMicros</a>. They have a miniUSB/RS232 or,
    on newer models, a USB-C/RS232 command line interface for reading and writing data. This interface allows the HP-15C
    Simulator to exchange data with these devices.
    <p>
    This documentation does not distinguish between the DM-15CC, the DM-15 and the DM15L. They are collectively referred to as the DM15.
    <p>

    <h3>HP 15C Collector's Edition</h3>
    The <a href="https://hpcalcs.com/product/hp-15c-collectors-edition/" target="_blank" class="internal">HP 15C Collector's Edition</a>
    ('HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE' for short) is the second reincarnation of the original HP-15C from HEWLETT-PACKARD, now HP Inc.
    after the HP 15C <span style="font: "Pristina Std">Limited Edition</span> released in 2011.
    <p>
    The HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE has a POGO pin connector on the back that can be used with the optional
    <a href="https://hpcalcs.com/product/hp-programming-cable/" target="_blank" class="internal">HP Programming Cable</a>.
    This allows it to update the firmware and back up and restore memory dumps with your computer.
    <p>
    Backup and restore operations are performed using the <a href="https://hpcalcs.com/download/" target="_blank" class="internal">VoyagerSave</a> application,
    which saves the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE's memory to a file or reads a file and sends it back to the device.
    <p>

    <h3>HP-15C Simulator</h3>
    To enable the support for the calculators in the Simulator, open the Preferences dialogue box. On the "Devices" tab enable
    the "DM15 Support" or the "HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE Support". You can also enable both. When the DM15 or HP15CE support is enabled,
    additional menu items are available:
    <ul>
      <li>the <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> popup menu has additional submenus for the "DM15" and the "HP15CE</li>
      <li>the main menu bar has an additional menu item "Devices"</li>
    </ul>
    The additional menus have the following entries for the "DM15" and the "HP15CE:
    <table class="TblLayout">
      <colgroup>
        <col style="width: 16%">

    <h2><a id="dm15">DM15</a></h2>
    The full description of the DM15 USB connection, the serial console and the driver installation can be found in the SwissMicros
    <a href="https://technical.swissmicros.com/voyager/doc/voyager_user_manual/#serial_console" target="_blank" class="internal">Voyager Series User Manual</a>.
    <p>
    <h3>USB To Serial Driver Installation</h3>
    To support the DM15 interface, a "CP2102 USB to UART bridge driver" must be available on your computer.

    <ul>
     <li><strong>Windows:</strong><br>
       Download and install the Windows driver from the <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers" target="_blank" class="internal">Silicon Labs drivers page</a>.
       <p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>Linux</strong><br>
         Current Linux systems should come with the necessary <span class="Command">cp210x</span> kernel modules.
         The module may not be enabled or loaded by default. See the <span class="Command">modprobe</span> and
         <span class="Command">lsusb</span> man pages for more details.
       <p>
     </li>
     <li><strong>macOS</strong><br>
       For macOS Catalina and earlier versions, download and install the driver from the
       <a href="https://www.silabs.com/developers/usb-to-uart-bridge-vcp-drivers" target="_blank" class="internal">Silicon Labs drivers page</a>.
       <p>
       Since macOS Big Sur a suitable driver is already built into the system. If you experience timeout problems with
       this driver, use the Silicon Labs driver.
       <p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    <h3>Serial Port Configuration</h3>
    Start the DM15 with <span class="fKeyLabel">C</span>&ndash;<span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> (press and hold <span class="fKeyLabel">C</span>,
    then press and release <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span>). The display will show "<code>SERIAL CONSOLE</code>". Connect the DM15
    to your computer and determine the number of the "Serial Interface Port" to which the USB connection is mapped:
    <ul>
     <li><strong>Windows:</strong><br>
       Open the Windows Device Manager. Under "Ports (COM & LPT)" find the entry
       "Silicon Labs CP210x USB to UART Bridge (COM<code>##</code>)" and note the COM port number.
       <p>
       </li>
       <li><strong>Linux</strong><br>
       Look for a device <span class="Command">/dev/ttyUSB*</span>. By default, and if no other serial port is connected,
       the port number should be <span class="Command">0</span>.
       <p>
       Make sure that you are a member of the same UNIX group, usually <span class="Command">dialout</span>, as the tty
       device. Otherwise you may not be able to read from or write to the device.
       <p>
     </li>
     <li><strong>macOS</strong><br>
       The Silicon Labs driver creates a device <span class="Command">/dev/cu.SLAB_USBtoUART</span> which does not take a port number.
       <p>
       The devices of the built-in driver have the form "<span class="Command">/dev/tty.usbserial-<em>####</em>"</span>.
       <p>
     </li>
    </ul>
    Open the Preferences dialogue box on the Simulator. On the "DM15" tab select the port number
    from the "Serial Interface Port" pull-down menu. This is not necessary for the macOS Silicon Labs driver.
    <p>
    <h3>Verifying The Setup</h3>
    To check the connection start the DM15 into the serial console and connect it to your computer. On the Simulator
    open the <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> popup menu and select "DM15&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;Read" or use the shortcut
    <span class="ShortCut">Ctrl</span>&ndash;<span class="ShortCut">&uarr;</span>. A dialogue box entitled
    "DM15&nbsp;read" will open. Ensure that at least one of the options is ticked and click "OK". You should see the
    message "Data read successfully". If you see a different message, refer to the
    <a href="#errormsgs" class="internal">Messages</a> section below.

    <h3>Firmwares</h3>
    There are three types of the DM15 firmware available. Each provides a different number of registers:
    <ul>
      <li>DM15: 64 registers; like the original HP-15C</li>
      <li>DM15_M80: 128 registers</li>
      <li>DM15_M1B: 229 registers</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
    Start the DM15 by holding down <span class="fKeyLabel">E</span> and then pressing <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span>.
    The firmware information will be displayed as long as the <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> key is held down. On the
    Simulator set the "Number of registers" to the number provided by the firmware of your DM15.
    <p>
    It is recommended that the HP-15C Simulator and the DM15 have the same number of registers. If the number of registers
    is different, it is likely that not all data can be exchanged between the two devices. Data transfer also depends on
    the memory allocation. For more details on memory allocation see "Appendix C Memory Allocation" in the
    <a href="http://www.hp.com/ctg/Manual/c03030589.pdf" target="_blank" class="internal">HP-15C LE Owner's Handbook</a>.
    <p>
    <strong>Note:</strong> You must install firmware version 9 or higher on your DM15. Earlier versions have problems
    with the command line interface and will not work.

    <p>

    <h3>System Information</h3>
    The menu item "<strong>System Info DM15</strong>" opens a new window with the following information about the DM15:
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firmware and version</strong>
        <p>
        The firmware type, with the total number of registers and the firmware version.
        <p>
      </li>
      <li><strong>Date and time</strong>
        <p>
        The date and time on the DM15 in the format "YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS" and the time difference, in seconds, to your computer.
        <p>
        The "<strong>Synchronise</strong>" button synchronises the DM15's clock with the computer's clock. Computer clocks
        are (usually) synchronised with an NTP server on the Internet and are more accurate than the DM15's internal clock.
        <p>
        The computer's date and time are written to the DM15 and then read back from the DM15 for validation.
        This <em>can</em> result in a time difference of 1 second, which can be ignored.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Battery voltage and remaining power</strong>
        <p>
        The current battery voltage and the estimated remaining power.
        <p>
        Measuring of the voltage affects the measurement itself. Immediately consecutive measurements may give different
        voltages. Batteries from different manufacturers have different discharge characteristics. The remaining power
        is therefore only an estimate.
        <p>
        This information is not available on the first batch of the credit card sized DM-15CCs.
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3><a id="dataexchg">Data Exchange</a></h3>
    <p>
    The following section assumes that you have successfully set up DM15 support in the HP-15C Simulator.
    The "Ask for each operation" option should be enabled.
    <p>
    First load a program into the Simulator, e.g. one of the examples available for download from the Simulator homepage.
    Connect the DM15 to your computer and start the DM15 into the serial port console. Select "DM15&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;Write"
    from the <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> popup menu or use the shortcut
    <span class="ShortCut">Ctrl</span>&ndash;<span class="ShortCut">&darr;</span>.
    The "DM15&nbsp;write</span>" dialogue box appears. Check "Program", uncheck the
    other options and click "OK". You should see the message "Data successfully written.".
    <p>
    Disconnect the DM15 from the computer and restart it or wait until the serial port console times out. Switch the
    DM15 to PRGM mode and press <span class="KeyLabel">SST</span> several times to check that the program has been
    successfully transferred to the DM15.
    <p>
    To read a program from the DM15 into the HP-15C Simulator, start the DM15 into the serial port console and connect
    it to your computer. Select "DM15&nbsp;&#9654;&nbsp;Read" from the <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> popup menu.
    In the "DM15&nbsp;read</span>" dialogue box check "Program", uncheck the
    other options and click "OK". You should see the message "Data read successfully.".


    <p style="text-align:right"><a href="#dm15" class="internal">&#9664; DM15</a>&nbsp;<a href="#top" class="internal">&#9650; Top</a>

    <h2><a id="hp15ce">HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE</a></h2>
    <h3>Modes</h3>
    The HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE firmware supports a standard mode with 96 registers and an (unofficial) mode with 192 registers.
    To switch between the two modes, follow these steps:
    <ol>
      <li>Turn off the calculator</li>
      <li>Press and hold the <span class="gKeyLabel">g</span> key and the <span class="KeyLabel">ENTER</span> key</li>
      <li>Turn on the calculator</li>
      <li>The display sbows <span class="DisplayInline">&ensp;1.L 2.C 3.H&ensp;</span>.
      Press <span class="KeyLabel">4</span> [sic]</li>
      <li>The display shows <span class="DisplayInline">&ensp;15&nbsp;15.2&ensp;&thinsp;16</span>.
      Press <span class="KeyLabel">e<sup>x</sup></span> for mode 15 with 92 registers and <span class="KeyLabel">y<sup>x</sup></span>
      for mode 15.2 with 196 registers</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
    <h3>Memory Files</h3>
    The Simulator cannot communicate directly with the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE, but it can read and write files in the VoyagerSave format.
    Files updated or created with the Simulator, can then be loaded into the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE using the VoyagerSave program.
    VoyagerSave files should have the file extension "<code>.15CE</code>" or "<code>.HP15CE</code>".
    <p>
    When reading a file, the simulator automatically detects the mode in which it was written.
    <p>
    So that the Simulator can write a file without first reading a memory dump from the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE, it has two built-in memory dumps.
    One for the 96 register mode and one for the 192 register mode. Both reflect the memory state in
    the respective mode after a reset, i.e. when the display shows <span class="DisplayInline">&nbsp;&nbsp;PR&nbsp;ERROR&nbsp;</span>.
    <p>
    When writing a file, the output mode, i.e. the total number of registers, must be specified. The output mode is selected from the
    'HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE Output Mode' menu item in the <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> popup menu and the 'Device' submenu in the main
    menu bar.
    <p>
    The following output file settings are made automatically:
    <ul>
      <li>The digit separators are set as in the Simulator</li>
      <li>The number of storage registers is set as in the Simulator</li>
      <li>If the number of storage registers on the Simulator exceeds 97, the output file will be set to 97 storage registers</li>
      <li>Complex mode is switched on in the output file, if the Simulator is in Complex mode</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>VoyagerSave</h3>
    You can downlaod the complete <a href="https://hpcalcs.com/downloads/apps/VoyagerSave_Instructions.pdf" target="_blank" class="internal">VoyagerSave Instructions</a> from the hpcalcs home page.
    The most important commands are:<br>
    <ul>
      <li>Put the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE in the mode for data exchange: Press and hold <span class="fKey">f</span> and
      <span class="KeyLabel">ENTER</span> simultaneously. Now press <span class="KeyLabel">ON</span>.</li>
      <li>Save HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE memory to a file: <code>VoyagerSave.exe -s <em>filename</em>.15CE</code></li>
      <li>Load memory to HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE: <code>VoyagerSave.exe -r <em>filename</em>.15CE</code></li></li>
    </ul>


    <p>
    <p style="text-align:right"><a href="#hp15ce" class="internal">&#9664; HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE</a>&nbsp;<a href="#top" class="internal">&#9650; Top</a>

    <h2><a id="hp15csim">HP-15C Simulator</a></h2>
    <h3>Memory Configuration</h3>
    <p>
    The HP-15C Simulator and the calculators are all configured completely independently of each other. This applies to the
    total number of registers, the memory allocation and all states such as complex mode, trigonometric modes etc.
    <p>
    The total number of registers of the simulator can only ever be set according to one DM15 firmware <em>or</em> one
    HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE mode. In other words, only one of the five possible values, i.e. 64, 96, 128, 192 and 229,
    is active at any one time.
    <p>
    The memory allocation on the target device is not changed automatically, even if not all data can be transferred.
    <br>
    There are exceptions to this rule when writing the memory dumps for the HP 15C CE. On the one hand, the total number of
    registers is determined by the selection of the memory dump with 96 or 192 registers. Secondly, the number of storage
    registers is set to the same value as in the simulator.


    <h3>Differing Configurations</h3>
    This section describes the results of different memory configurations on the source and target devices in detail.
    <p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Program</strong>
      <p>
      A program is transferred if the target device configuration provides at least as many registers in the common pool
      as the program allocates. For example, let's take the following combination: An HP-15C Simulator with 46 program
      registers and a DM15 with the 128 register firmware and the standard layout with 110 program registers. All programs
      from the Simulator can be written to the DM15, but not vice versa.
      <p>
      Increasing the number of data storage registers on the DM15 to 100, key sequence
      <span class="KeyLabel">1</span>&nbsp;<span class="KeyLabel">0</span>&nbsp;<span class="KeyLabel">0</span>&nbsp;<span class="fKey">f</span>&nbsp;
      <span class="fKeyLabel">DIM</span>&nbsp;<span class="fKeyLabel">(i)</span>, reduces the number of registers in the
      common pool to 29. Now only simulator programs that allocate up to 29 registers can be written to the DM15. Even though
      the total number of registers on the DM15 (128) is higher
      than that on the Simulator (64).
      </li>
      <li><strong>Data Storage Registers</strong>
      <p>
      The data storage registers are only transferred if the target device has at least as many data storage registers
      as the source device. Otherwise, the error "Too many storage registers for current memory configuration. <em>X</em>
      registers available, <em>Y</em> required" will occur. If you get this message, check the memory configuration
      on both devices with <span class="gKey">g</span>&nbsp;<span class="gKeyLabel">MEM</span> and adapt them accordingly.
      <p>
      Example 1: The Simulator shows <span class="DisplayInline">&nbsp;19.110&nbsp;&nbsp;0-0</span> and the DM15 shows
      <span class="DisplayInline">&nbsp;30.&nbsp;99&nbsp;&nbsp;0-0</span>. The 19 storage registers on the Simulator can
      be transferred to the first 19 of the 30 registers on the DM15 without any problem. If you try to transfer data in
      the opposite direction, not all 30 registers can be transferred and the message is shown.
      <p>
      Example 2: The Simulator shows <span class="DisplayInline">&nbsp;19.211&nbsp;&nbsp;0-0</span> and the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE
      shows <span class="DisplayInline">&nbsp;94.&nbsp;99&nbsp;00-0</span>. Although the total number of registers on the Simulator
      is 229, there are not enough storage registers to read them all into the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE. On the other hand, all
      program steps on the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE can be read into the Simulator.
      <p>
      Additional data storage registers on the target device remain unchanged.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Stack</strong>
      <p>
      The real stack can always be transferred. The complex stack will only be transferred if both the source and the
      target device are in Complex mode. No warning or error message is shown, if the complex stack is not transferred.
      <p>
      When the Simulator is in Complex mode, the memory dumps for the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE are written with Complex
      mode on. The complex stack is transferred in that case.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Flags</strong>
      <p>
      The flags 0 to 7 are always transferred. Flag 9, display blinking, is never transferred.
      <p>
      Flag 8, Complex mode, is not transferred between the Simulator and the DM15 in both direction.
      Flag 8 is transferred from the Simulator to the HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE, but not in the other direction.
      <p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Reading and Writing Data</h3>
    <p>
    In the dialogue box that opens when you select Read or Write, you can select what data is to be exchanged between
    a calculator and the Simulator. Any combination of program memory, data storage registers, matrices, stack or flags can
    be selected. An area not selected for exchange will remain unchanged on the target device.
    <p>
    The settings are saved as defaults. If you do not want to be prompted for each and every read or write operation,
    uncheck the "Ask for each operation" option in the preferences.

    <h3><a>All devices</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Firmware not identified.</strong>
      <p>
      When reading from the DM15 or from an HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE memory file, the Simulator could not retrieve the firmware
      from the data.<br>
      A correct firmware identification is needed to detect conflicting memory configurations between the Simulator and the device.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Unknown code '<em>##</em>'.</strong>
      <p>
      The program to be loaded contains an unknown key code.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Memory not initialised</strong>
      <p>
      The memory from the device, DM15 or HP&thinsp;15C&thinsp;CE, has not been fully loaded.
      <li><strong>Too many data storage registers for current memory configuration. <em>n</em> registers available, <em>m</em> required.</strong>
      <p>
      On the source device are more registers assigned as data storage than on the target device.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Too many matrix elements for current memory configuration. <em>n</em> registers available, <em>m</em> required.</strong>
      <p>
      There are not enough free registers in the pool to transfer all matrix elements.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Program too large for current memory configuration. <em>n</em> registers available, <em>m</em> required.</strong>
      <p>
      The programs allocate more registers than are available on the target device.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h3><a>DM15L</a></h3>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Error while reading / writing</strong>
      <p>
      An error has occurred when writing [reading] the DM15 memory.<br>
      Please ensure that you have firmware version 9 or higher installed on your DM15. If the problem persists, please contact me.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Error when connecting via serial port <em>#</em></strong>
      <p>
      This error occurs when there is no device connected to the serial port that is configured in the "Preferences".
      </li>
      <li><strong>Connection timed out</strong>
      <p>
      After a period of inactivity (~ 60 seconds) the DM15's command line interface will time-out and switch to Run mode.<br>
      Restart the DM15 with <span class="fKeyLabel">C</span>&ndash;<span class="KeyLabel">ON</span> to reactivate the command line interface.
      </li>
      <li><strong>'/dev/ttyUSB<em>#</em>' was not recognised as a serial device</strong>
      <p>
      On some Linux systems "<code>/dev/ttyUSB#</code>" may not be recognised as a serial device.
      </li>
      <li><strong>Serial Port not configured. See Preferences dialogue.</strong>
      <p>
      The port number for the serial port is not set in the preferences.
